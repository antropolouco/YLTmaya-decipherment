# LaTeX
LaTeX is a mark-up language which allows creating big scalable documents by writing
plain-old text using commands to enrich the text, embed images and tables, cite and reference
other sources like papers, books and websites scientifically.
The project is then compiled by so-called Tex distribution (e.g. Tex Live) to produce the final
document, usually a PDF file.
One writes in the mark-up language in a text editor of choice and generates the document afterwards.
Writing a text this way is not a WYSIWYG-style of writing like for example in Word where you see how the document looks like.
With LaTeX one writes plain text and formatting commands to tell LaTeX how the document should look like.
The compilation process will generate the final and well-formatted document.
The advantage of this approach is, that the style and appearance can be easily changed by set of instructions which affetcs the document immediatly and globally.

The document regardless whether it is a book, article etc. can be split in different files
including subfolders.
Therefore, it is possible to create structure of folders and files to separate several concerns
like chapters, paragraphs or appendixes.
It has several packages which deals with many aspects of writing (e.g. graphics, math symbols).
It's even possible to define your own commands which enables one to program and automate
extensive tasks and simplifies the way one writes text.
