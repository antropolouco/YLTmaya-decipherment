The project is open source and free.
Knowledge should be free and accessible to everyone.
The history of deciperment of Maya hieroglyphs should be readable and understandable to anyone
interested in this manner.
All texts, images and illustrations should be publicly available, so that the great
process of decipherment can be shared with everyone around the world. 

# Who can contribute?
Any help is greatly appreciated.
If you find problems within the document of any kind, please feel free create issues
which address your findings.
This will greatly help to improve the project.

## How can I contribute?
If you would like to become part of the project, you are more than welcome to do so.
Please get in touch with and reach me via academia.edu 
[here](https://independent.academia.edu/SebastianBauer16).
The one important thing is, that you have an account on GitHub.
You can easily create one for free if you don't have one yet.
Then, it's easy to become a collaborator and join the project.

## Authoring
If you would like to become a writer for the project, then this part is for you.
Once you are a collaborator, you can create a branch and work on the document as much as you like.
Whether it is small change or maybe some major refactoring is totally up to you.
However, in order to get applied to the document, a review by at least one or two reviewers is necessary.
So, when you are done with your changes, one has to open a pull request for the `main` branch.
After the reviewers give their okay and the continuous integration is green, your contribution will be
part of the project.
