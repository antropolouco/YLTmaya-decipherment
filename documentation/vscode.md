## VSCode and docker
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a source code editor and development tool.
It has the opportunity to be used in conjunction with docker containers 
(see [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)).
This project fully supports docker containers as it is also used during 
the continuous integration cycle.
It's an easy and isolated way to create a LaTeX environment and everything a consumer or writer
needs to compile the final PDF file.
