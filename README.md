# Changelog
The changelog format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to a variant of [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).

Version scheme:

The version of the document is basically the date of the release. 
The release date is converted to a Maya Long Count date using the Martin-Skidmore 
correlation (584286) and then written out in the standard Long Count notation.
For example, `2022-12-30` would be written as `13.0.10.2.18`.

Every changelog entry consists of the version string and the Gregorian release date 
using ISO format YYYY-MM-DD: 

`[<long count of release date>] - <release date in ISO format>`
