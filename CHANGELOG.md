# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to variant of [Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/).

Version scheme:

The version of the document is basically the date of the release. 
It is represented by the Maya Long Count notation of the release date 
using the Martin-Skidmore correlation (584286).

Every changelog entry consists of the version string and the Gregorian release date 
using ISO format YYYY-MM-DD: 

`[<long count of release date>] - <release date in ISO format>`
