\chapter{Terminology}

\section{Grapheme}
\textcquote[204]{crystal2010}{Graphemes are the smallest units in a writing system capable of 
causing a contrast in meaning.}
In linguistics, graphemes are often placed into angle brackets, e.g. \grapheme{a} or \grapheme{b}.
Sometimes \emph{graphemes} are called \emph{signs}.
The term \emph{sign} and \emph{grapheme} are considered to be equivalent and 
interchangeable throughout this work.

\section{Allograph}
\textcquote[204]{crystal2010}{Graphemes are abstract units which may adopt a variety of forms 
\elide Each of these possible forms is known as \emph{graphs}\elide
There is a vast amount of physical variation in the shapes of graphs that does not affect the 
underlying identity of the grapheme\elide 
When graphs are analyzed as variants of a grapheme, they are known as \emph{allographs}.}
The Maya script uses a lot of allographs.
For example, the syllable \syllable{u} can be written in many ways all having the same meaning.
See~\ref{fig:terminology-grapheme-u-allographs} for a selection of allographs.

\end{center}

\section{Hieroglyph and glyph}
The term \emph{hieroglyph} or \emph{glyph} is not an exact term.
In epigraphic literature, a \emph{glyph} is considered to be a group of one or more graphemes.
They can represent a syllable, single words or even a whole phrase 
(\cite[1]{bricker1986}, (\cite[23]{macrilooper2003})).
For example, the glyph~\ref{fig:terminology-glyphs-utzapaw} consists of the 
graphemes \grapheme{u}, \grapheme{tz\glottalstop{}a} and \grapheme{wa} representing the phrase
\mayan{u tz\glottalstop{}apaw}, ``she/he erects it''.
The glyph~\ref{fig:terminology-glyphs-ixwinikhaabajaw} consisting of the 
graphemes \grapheme{ix}, \grapheme{winikhaab} and \grapheme{ajaw}
and represents the noble title \mayan{ix winikhaab ajaw}, ``Ruler Lady Winikhaab''.

    \end{subfigure}

\section{Glyph block and collocation}
\emph{Glyphs} are usually arranged in regular rectangular shapes called a \emph{glyph block}.
\textcquote[23]{macrilooper2003}{The rectangular shape of \emph{glyph blocks} results from 
the arrangement of texts into rows and columns}.
\todo{Image/drawing which shows rows and columns of glyphs}

\section{Analysis of an unknown writing system}
Without linguistic decipherment, one of the first steps to analyze an unknown writing system, is
to distinguish distinctive graphemes and their allographs. 
researchers followed the assumption that graphemes of a script are considered the same if 
they resemble each other in more features than either resembles any other.
\textcquote[34]{knorozov1967}{Two [signs] are identical when they are both composed of the same 
graphic elements\elide, whose drawing and disposition is sufficiently similar to allow them to 
be identified.}
One way to do this is the segmentation of texts into distinct graphemes.
Further distribution analyzes confirms the connection and identification.

\section{Problems and limitations}

However, if there is no control in terms linguistics and content, 
identifying graphemes in an unknown writing system can be challenging.
Eric Thompson (\cite[12\psq]{thompson1962catalog}) recognized the method as a source of 
potential false conclusions.
Especially in writing systems with many allographs like the Maya hieroglyphs,
allographs are not recognized and interpreted as separate graphemes. 
Another problem is that some graphemes
